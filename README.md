Hello!
I offer you a useful script that will help you organize tab switching on the site.
The script is written in JavaScript.

- You can use the functionality of the script lying in ..\js\sTscript.js
For this:
1. copy ..\sTscript.js   to a folder   ..\js\   on your site ;
2. added <script src = "js/sTscript.js"> in your site index.html file </script>"
before the tag  </body>.
(this is at the end of the file);
3. Open the file ../js/sTscript.js
and in lines 5 and 6, which should be taken from your Index.html.
(let tabContent = (your marriage) ,
     info = (your marriage))

- You can also integrate styles and tables into your site.
For this:
1. copy all the files from the folder ../css/ to your site's folder ../css/ ;
2. added <script src = "js/sTscript.js"> in your site index.html file </script>"
before the tag  </body>.
3. copy lines 12 through 73 in your site's index.html


Enjoy!
